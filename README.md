# graph-algorithms

Repository contains implementations of graph algorithms for AGH UST graph algorithm course.

lab1 - finding path between s and t nodes with maximum minimum edge weight in directed weighted graph (union-find, modified djisktra, BFS-DFS and binsearch).

lab2 - max-flows (Ford-Fulkerson method, Edmonds-Karp algorithm).

lab3 - min-cut problem (Ford-Fulkerson method).

lab4 - min-cut problem (Stoer-Wagner algorithm).

lab5, (lab 6) - chordal graphs, lex-bfs, vertex-coloring, finding max clique and vertex cover.

proj - implementation of algorithm for finding min-cost max-flow for a algorithmic problem.
